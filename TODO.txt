TODO/WISH LIST
--------------

Code: Some bits of the code are ugly:
 	- vector module, matpy module and Numpy package, all offer similar functionality. 
	  Use only one, get rid of two. 
	- more documentation!

Speed: The solver is currently much too slow. The problem is the pattern matching algorithms that is used to find 
combinations of clusters that can be rewritten/merged. Solutions:
	- hand-coded matching algorithms per merge rule (labourous and error prone)
	- incremental pattern matching system (work in progress)
	- compliled implementation (Psycho/C++/Haskell/???)

Rules: More rewrite rules to increase the problem domain:
	- larger subproblems (octahedron, variable radius spheres/cylinders)
	- new clusters types (N degrees of freedom)

Extentions:
	- implement geometry: lines, planes, spheres, cylinders, tori (mappings to cluster)
	- constraints on parameters (equality, algebraic constraints)
	- different variable domains (integers, reals, n-dimensional points, surfaces, volumes, logic variables, lists)
